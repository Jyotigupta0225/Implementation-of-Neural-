# Implementation-of-Neural-Network
This repository is based on the first course (Neural Networks and Deep Learning) of the Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew NG.

### [1. Simple Neural Network](https://github.com/Jyotigupta0225/Implementation-of-Neural-Network/tree/master/Neural%20Network%20(Scratch)/Simple%20Neural%20Network)</br>
Neural Network having a single layer with only one neuron.


### [2. Shallow Neural Network( 1 hidden layer)](https://github.com/Jyotigupta0225/Implementation-of-Neural-Network/tree/master/Neural%20Network%20(Scratch)/Shallow%20Neural%20Network(1%20hidden%20layer))</br>
Neural Network having a single layer with 'n' neurons.


### [3. Deep Neural Network( L hidden layers)](https://github.com/Jyotigupta0225/Implementation-of-Neural-Network/tree/master/Neural%20Network%20(Scratch)/Deep%20Neural%20Network(L%20hidden%20layers))</br>
Neural Network having 'L' layers with multiple neurons each.
