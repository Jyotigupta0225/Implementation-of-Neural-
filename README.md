# Implementation-of-Neural-Network
This repository is based on the first course (Neural Networks and Deep Learning) of the Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew NG.


### [*Simple Neural Network*](https://github.com/Jyotigupta0225/Implementation-of-Neural-Network/tree/master/Neural%20Network%20(Scratch)/Simple%20Neural%20Network)</br>
Neural Network having a single layer with only one neuron


### [**Shallow Neural Network(1 hidden layer)**](https://github.com/Jyotigupta0225/Implementation-of-Neural-Network/tree/master/Neural%20Network%20(Scratch)/Shallow%20Neural%20Network(1%20hidden%20layer))</br>
Neural Network having a 1 hidden layer with 'n' neurons


### [3. Deep Neural Network(L hidden layers)](https://github.com/Jyotigupta0225/Implementation-of-Neural-Network/tree/master/Neural%20Network%20(Scratch)/Deep%20Neural%20Network(L%20hidden%20layers))</br>
Neural Network having 'L' layers with multiple neurons each


### [4. Gradient Checking](https://github.com/jyoti0225/Implementation-of-Neural-Network/blob/master/Gradient%20Checking/)</br>
Checking the correct implementation of Gradient descent


### [5. Regularization](https://github.com/jyoti0225/Implementation-of-Neural-Network/tree/master/Regularization)</br>
Implement the various regularization techniques like L2 Regularization and DroupOut


### [**Optimization](https://github.com/jyoti0225/Implementation-of-Neural-Network/tree/master/Optimization)</br>
Implement various optimization methods like mini-batch, ADAM, RMS-prop, and Momentum
